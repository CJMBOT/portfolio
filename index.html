            Welcome to the project portfolio of Curtis Mays. Curtis started learning to code in 2023 via a series
            of courses on <span id="codelink">Codecademy.</span> As part of the Full Stack Engineer course he was tasked with
            creating this website to showcase all of his projects. These projects vary from simple assignments for learning to 
            larger endeavours combining a variety of ideas and skills. Take a look at the cards below for a brief desciption 
            of each project or click on them for more detail including links to github repositories.
